An app for collecting and organizing bookmarks for all the resources one might need for studying web development.


> Technologies Used:

This app was built using Ruby on Rails, and includes some HTML and CSS.


> Approach Taken:

I drew inspiration from my Chrome Bookmarks list, Pinterest, and Slack to determine features I'd want my application to have.
